lots of code to go through on this one.
let's start with safeinclude
it removes ../ from whatever is passed to it
also exits if it is passed anything containing the string "natas_webpass"
safeinclude is only called in the setLangauge function
this effectively prevents injection into this part of the application

next up is listFiles
it takes $path as input
creates a blank array $listoffiles
then, if the path exists (opendir returns false if $path is invalid)
it sets $handle to the directory path returned from opendir
then, while readdir is not false, $file is set to the filename returned from $handle passed to readdir
next, if the filename is not . or .., the filename ($file from readdir) is appended to the array $listoffiles 
the directory is then closed and the list of files is returned.
listFiles is called when the page loads to set the langauge. 
it is passed "language/" and returns "en" and "de" as options in the dropdown menu on the page.
presumeably, there are two files in the language directory

next is logRequest
this takes $message as input, then creates a log entry in the log file
it starts with [date]
then appends the HTTP USER AGENT header
followed by $message, and ends with a newline.
it then appends (or creates if it does not exist) the file in the following format:
"/var/www/natas/natas25/logs/natas25_" . session_id() .".log"
writes the log message to the file, then closes the file.

lastly, let's check out setLangauge
it's called when the page loads, and if $lang is in $_SESSION, and if $lang passes safeinclude
it returns 1
otherwise it defaults to "language/en"

now that we've gone over all the funcitons, lets take a look at how it all works together

when the page loads, listFiles is called and it loads the two files in languages/, en and de.
the files are put into the dropdown language menu.
they are also passed through the safeinclude funciton, so we can't inject into these.

start_session is then called to create a session, and setLangauge is called to load the content on the page

seems the best bet is to try to inject into the log files
logRequest is only called when safeinclude detects "../" or "natas_webpass"
safeinclude is only called when setting the langauge.
setting $lang to natas_webpass will trigger safeinclude to make a logRequest
then HTTP USER AGENT can be manipulated to get the password for the next level.

if the log can be saved in the language folder, it should be readable from the main page.
some php will need to be injeced into the USER AGENT header to save it there.
unfortunately i don't think this is going to work because it requires more than one line of php

file_get_contents("/etc/natas_webpass/natas26");

putting this in the USER AGENT header should write the password into the log
now to find a way to access the log...

the safeinclude function is not recurseive, so if a ../ is embedded inside another ../
like so ..././
it should be possible to pull the log file

this does work, but the php code in the USER AGENT isn't executing, it's just displayed as text in the log.
in order for this to work, it needs to be wrapped in <?php ?>, and include an echo.

final payload looks like this

GET /?lang=../
...
User-Agent: <?php echo file_get_contents("/etc/natas_webpass/natas26"); ?>

then

GET /?lang=..././..././..././..././..././ + path to log file
