this one is similar to the last one, but it uses the strcmp function.
according to the docs, it is a binary safe string comparison
returns int as follows:
less 0 if str1 is less than str2; > 0 if str1 is greater than str2, and 0 if they are equal.

hints say to look at how to break strcmp
a quick google search shows that if you set passwd to a blank array, it will return 0

so adding ?passwd[]="" to the url completes the challenge
