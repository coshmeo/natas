source code review shows that we have 2 conditions:
    1. the password must contain the string "iloveyou"
    1. it must also evaluate to an integer greater than 10

hints say something about type casting...

after messing around with converting strings to integers, php appears to behave as follows
it looks at the first character of the string, if it's a number, then it moves on, otherwise it returns 0

so to solve this challenge, you just need to start with a number greater than 10, followed by iloveyou
because the strstr() funtion find the first occurance of the string
it doesn't care where in the string it is.
