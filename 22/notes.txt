at first glance, the page is blank.
looking at the page source, it looks like we need to add "revelio" to our GET request

if revelio is in our GET request, then the credentials will print

if $_SESSION doesn't exist and admin isn't in $_SESSION and admin isn't 1, then the header Location is set to /

maybe we can try header injection?

changing the Host header to revelio (intead of url) returns the following:
