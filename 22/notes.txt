at first glance, the page is blank.
looking at the page source, it looks like we need to add "revelio" to our GET request

if revelio is in our GET request, then the credentials will print

if $_SESSION doesn't exist and admin isn't in $_SESSION and admin isn't 1, then the header Location is set to /

maybe we can try header injection?

changing the Host header to revelio (intead of url) returns a 200 OK and then redirects to the natas start page

adding /index.php returns the same page, but still no admin...
what if we added revelio to that in the GET request?

it works!

adding /index.php?revelio to the GET request returns the admin creds for the next level.
note: this must be done in brup, doesn't work if you add it to the url in browser.
