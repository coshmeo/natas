this one has 2 pages, natas21, and natas21-experimenter
it has the print_credentials() function from last time
looks like we need to use the experimenter page to add admin to $_SESSION

first glance at the experimenter page, there are 3 text fields 
these are controls for the 'example'

they are controlled by the following php code
$style = "background-color: ".$_SESSION["bgcolor"]."; text-align: ".$_SESSION["align"]."; font-size: ".$_SESSION["fontsize"].";";

from the page-source, there are two sections with comments

// only allow these keys
$validkeys = array("align" => "center", "fontsize" => "100%", "bgcolor" => "yellow");
$form = "";

$validkeys appears to restrict what keys can be submitted to $_SESSION.
it is also referenced in the following php code which creates a form on the page

$form = "";

$form .= '<form action="index.php" method="POST">';
foreach($validkeys as $key => $defval) {
    $val = $defval;
    if(array_key_exists($key, $_SESSION)) {
    $val = $_SESSION[$key];
    } else {
    $_SESSION[$key] = $val;
    }
    $form .= "$key: <input name='$key' value='$val' /><br>";
}
$form .= '<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Update" />';
$form .= '</form>';

which is then processed by the code at the top.

// if update was submitted, store it
if(array_key_exists("submit", $_REQUEST)) {
    foreach($_REQUEST as $key => $val) {
    $_SESSION[$key] = $val;
    }
}

we can check the contents of $_SESSION with the debug function

index.php?debug

the goal is to set $_SESSION["admin"] = 1

setting the align to // results in a blank $_SESSION
so we can assume that we can at least somewhat inject into the php where it's creating the form

particularly on line 29
$form .= "$key: <input name='$key' value='$val' /><br>";

we can inject some php into $val
tried using delete with html entity encoding
&#127;
just seems to add a blank character though.

entering
'<input name='admin' value='1' /><br>";//
results in a textbox showing up in debug (see progress.jpg)

'/><br>";} form = "'admin' <input name='admin' value='1' /><br>"

setting 'align' to the value above adds a text box under align, which you can then submit again using the update button
this adds 'admin' = '1' to $_SESSION
then, go back to the main natas21 page, and refresh it to get the password for the next level

note: make sure that the cookie value on natas21 is the same as the one on experimenter
