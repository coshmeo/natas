variables we control
username & password

mysql_real_escape_string() calls MySQL's library function mysql_real_escape_string, 
which prepends backslashes to the following characters: \x00, \n, \r, \, ', " and \x1a. 

this is a deprecated function and can most likely be bypassed. further research required.

as before, the username for the next level is natas28.

if the request thas username and password in it, it will check if the user is valid, then check the password
if the password is valid, it displays the data, otherwise it says 'wrong password'
if the username doesn't exist, it creates it with the password in the request.

each function in the application uses mysql_real_escape_string.
the goal is to get the application to call dumpData for natas28

what if we created a username that tricks the database into giving us natas28 data?
