variables we control:
    x1 y1 x2 y2

cookies we control:
    drawing (x & y variables above in php array format)

Logger class
    not called directly by the application, but can be exploited.

    methods
        __construct
            takes $file as input
            creates log, or appends msgs to existing file
            variable $logFile sets path to /tmp/natas26_" . $file . ".log"
            perhaps this can be changed to display log on the main page?
                main page location should be
                /var/www/natas26/

        log
            takes $msg as input, appends $msg to log file
            uses location stored in $logFile

        __destruct
            no input, appends closing msg defined in $exitMsg to log file

    $mylog = new Logger($file);
        creates a new Logger class, referenced by the object $mylog
            __construct($file);
            is automatically called upon creation of a new Logger instance
            creates a log at location /tmp/natas26_`$file`.log
            and sets private $logFile variable in Logger to $file
        
    mylog->log($msg);
        adds $msg to log file. 
        if $msg = <?php file_get_contents(/etc/natas_webpass/natas27) ?> it should print the password for the next level in the log file

attack plan:
    create a Logger class
    change $logFile to a location i can access from the main page
    make Logger log a $msg containing php code which will get the password
    access the log

our attack vector should be through the drawing cookie using php object injection
drawing cookie is seralized and base64 encoded

some code like this should create a Logger

    class Example2
    {
    private $hook = "phpinfo();";
    }

    print urlencode(serialize(new Example2));

which will be attached to a request like this

    GET /vuln.php HTTP/1.0
    Host: testsite.com
    Cookie: data=O%3A8%3A%22Example2%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A14%3A%22%00Example2%00hook%22%3Bs%3A10%3A%22phpinfo%28%29%3B%22%3B%7D
