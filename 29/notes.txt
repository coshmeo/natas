possible regex for the string 'natas'
denies request, does not remove from query (so can't exploit a non-recursive function)
appears to be written in perl.

regex probably looks somehting like

if 'natas' in string:
    deny request;
    print meep;
else:
    send request;

when the request is sent to the server, it rcvs `file` & looks for it, then sends it back to the website

per https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/linux-systems/programing-languages/perl/

open() function is vulnerable and can be used to execute commands
# ex : “| shutdown -r |”
