possible regex for the string 'natas'
denies request, does not remove from query (so can't exploit a non-recursive function)
appears to be written in perl.

regex probably looks somehting like

if 'natas' in string:
    deny request;
    print meep;
else:
    send request;

when the request is sent to the server, it rcvs `file` & looks for it, then sends it back to the website

per https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/linux-systems/programing-languages/perl/

open() function is vulnerable and can be used to execute commands
# ex : “| shutdown -r |”

| echo /etc works, but the natas filter still applies here, so we need to find a way around that.
it also appears the function is appending .txt to the input.

my initial thought is to try using grep to search for the path, using wildcards to bypass the filter.
something like `grep /etc/nata*_webpass/nata*30`
