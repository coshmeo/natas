seems like 9 & 10 but with more filtering?

.* ../../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas17 doesn't work, but doesn't return 'Input contains an illegal character!'

subshells - executing a shell command inside another shell command
only works because the command we are inecting into uses double quotes
$(command goes here)
