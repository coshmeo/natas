no page source :(

searching for < or > results in a blank page, seems to break the application (maybe?)

when searching for things, the query parameter is always divisble by 16 (suspicious)

encryption!
block cipher
breaking up input into blocks & padding blocks on decryption
AES?

be aware of how the cipher text changes when i change my query, keeping in mind the length of the blocks.
