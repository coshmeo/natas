looks like they're doing custom encoding now
involves reading & writing session id from a file on the server?
does not appear to be static anymore

name        PHPSESSID
admin   --> rj4qlpd1ncn3u57jm5jnfv4f85
admin   --> rgtutitq84a5tbe6vv2b7ur562
admin   --> euafj84lt2q70too75b1j4tdc5
admin   --> 3oob6epa7e7mrpri4070h7ncp3

hints say i should look at how past sessions are being encoded, how to add fields, and each field occupies one line

function myread($sid) { 
    debug("MYREAD $sid"); 
    if(strspn($sid, "1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM-") != strlen($sid)) {
    debug("Invalid SID"); 
        return "";
    }
    $filename = session_save_path() . "/" . "mysess_" . $sid;
    if(!file_exists($filename)) {
        debug("Session file doesn't exist");
        return "";
    }
    debug("Reading from ". $filename);
    $data = file_get_contents($filename); --> this pulls data from the file $filename defined above
    $_SESSION = array();
    foreach(explode("\n", $data) as $line) {
        debug("Read [$line]");
    $parts = explode(" ", $line, 2);
    if($parts[0] != "") $_SESSION[$parts[0]] = $parts[1];
    }
    return session_encode();
}

function mywrite($sid, $data) { 
    // $data contains the serialized version of $_SESSION
    // but our encoding is better
    debug("MYWRITE $sid $data"); 
    // make sure the sid is alnum only!!
    if(strspn($sid, "1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM-") != strlen($sid)) {
    debug("Invalid SID"); 
        return;
    }
    $filename = session_save_path() . "/" . "mysess_" . $sid;
    $data = "";
    debug("Saving in ". $filename);
    ksort($_SESSION);
    foreach($_SESSION as $key => $value) {
        debug("$key => $value");
        $data .= "$key $value\n";
    }
    file_put_contents($filename, $data);
    chmod($filename, 0600);
}

$_SESSION An associative array containing session variables available to the current script
    for this challenge, it has at least 2 elements:
        "admin" & "name"
        possibly more?

if(strspn($sid, "1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM-") != strlen($sid)) {
    debug("Invalid SID"); 
    return "";
}
    this throws an error and cancels myread() or mywrite() if the lengths don't match.
    strspn per php docs:
        Finds the length of the initial segment of a string consisting entirely of characters contained within a given mask 
        strspn(
        string $string,
        string $characters,
        int $offset = 0,
        ?int $length = null
        ): int

so effectively it just makes sure that $sid only contains characters in the given set

$data = file_get_contents($filename); 
$_SESSION = array();
foreach(explode("\n", $data) as $line) {
    debug("Read [$line]");
    $parts = explode(" ", $line, 2);
    if($parts[0] != "") $_SESSION[$parts[0]] = $parts[1];
}
return session_encode();

so here, $data is set to the contents of the saved session file, then it sets $_SESSION to a blank array.
next, for each line in $data (separated by newline (\n)) it separates the lines at the spaces.
then it sets the second part ($parts[1]) equal to the first part, if the first part ($parts[0]) isn't blank.

finally it returns the session_encode, which encodes $_SESSION

session_encode() works like this:
    session_start();

    $_SESSION['sid'] = 120;
    $_SESSION['admin'] = 1;
    $_SESSION['name'] = 'admin';


echo session_encode();
returns the following:
sid|i:120;admin|i:1;name|s:5:"admin";

now let's take a look at what the mywrite function does

function mywrite($sid, $data) { 
    // $data contains the serialized version of $_SESSION
    // but our encoding is better
    debug("MYWRITE $sid $data"); 
    // make sure the sid is alnum only!!
    if(strspn($sid, "1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM-") != strlen($sid)) {
    debug("Invalid SID"); 
        return;
}

so this part is pretty similar to myread, it just checks to make sure $sid contains the characters they want
clearly here, they think they are smarter than the php devs...hehe. undoubtedly, it is 'better'

    $filename = session_save_path() . "/" . "mysess_" . $sid;
    $data = "";
    debug("Saving in ". $filename);
    ksort($_SESSION);
    foreach($_SESSION as $key => $value) {
        debug("$key => $value");
        $data .= "$key $value\n";
    }
    file_put_contents($filename, $data);
    chmod($filename, 0600);

so once it has has validated $sid, it sets $filename to the stored session save path (probably /var/www/html or something)
and then adds /mysess_ + the value of $sid.
next sets $data as a blank string
then it does ksort on $_SESSION.
ksort sorts array keys in ascending order (alphabetical, it seems?)
assuming our 3 elements of $_SESSION are admin, name, and sid:
    it would sort them in alphabetical order
    admin: 1
    name: admin
    sid: 123
so it ksorts them, and then appends $key & $value to $data, which looks like this:
    admin 1 name admin sid 120
then it writes $data to $filename, and sets permissions with chmod
code 0600 means: Read and write for owner, nothing for everybody else

so, the session file would look something like this once it's been through mywrite()
    admin 1
    name admin
    sid 123

now that we've gone through the custom read/write functions, let's take a look at the rest of the code.

session_set_save_handler(
    "myopen", 
    "myclose", 
    "myread", 
    "mywrite", 
    "mydestroy", 
    "mygarbage");
sets the order of operations & tells php which functions to use
so effectively, it reads, then writes, and that's it since all of the other functions are commented out to return True.

it calls session_start(), which initializes the php session.
per php docs:
    creates a session or resumes the current one based on a session identifier passed via a GET or POST request, 
    or passed via a cookie

lastly, we have 
if(array_key_exists("name", $_REQUEST)) {
    $_SESSION["name"] = $_REQUEST["name"];
    debug("Name set to " . $_REQUEST["name"]);
}

which just adds 'name' to $_SESSION if 'name' is in $_REQUEST.

so...we've gone through all the php on the page, but i'm still not sure where PHPSESSID is being created.

further recon shows PHPSESSID is always 26 characters long

name        PHPSESSID                   length
a       --> 0ir1a49b57rffjdq9h1m1llo54  len: 26
ad      --> 20uiu4aqenpv8r4akth5nem101  len: 26
adm     --> kkh4naorcfrof9p9rcqt7q0gu1  len: 26
admi    --> h7aq6tk4c5l51f4ifnvfme10q0  len: 26
admin   --> dd9r6cgne57tam7rpoen325h17  len: 26
admin   --> hmn99sq61pcpt2r3l49cedkj33  len: 26
admin   --> 5nd891geihcc27eao8g5qrvi43  len: 26
admin   --> 7348f1e49hgf6sit47v3hsqck6  len: 26
admin   --> l10nccurthsbjh1n07sci4bg10  len: 26

there also don't seem to be any capital letters...
not sure what to make of this but it seems like it's worth noting.

turns out i was thinking about this all wrong, focus should be on exploiting the php
reviewed this w my mentor, he pointed out that you can use the debug function
this will show what's going on behind the scenes. 
just add `?debug` to the URL to use it.
looking at the mywrite function, it breaks the input out by line.
so, if we can add a newline to the variable we control ($name), we could add admin
to do this, just add `%0a` (HTML encoded newline) and admin 1 (%20 is HTML encoded space.)

the payload looks like this:

url?debug&name=test%0aadmin%201


once you've submitted this, you just need to call the myread() function
this can be accomplished by reloading the page.
et voila, the password appears!
